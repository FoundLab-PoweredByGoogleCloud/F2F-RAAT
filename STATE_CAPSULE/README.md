# State Capsule Specification

This directory defines the specification for the **State Capsule**.

The State Capsule is the **PII-free, non-Turing-complete, and cryptographically verifiable boundary object** within the FoundLab ATI. Its purpose is to carry an entity's reputational state across the system without ever exposing the underlying sensitive data.

It is a foundational element of the **Zero-Persistence** pillar of our architecture. For more context, see [The Three Pillars of Trust by Physics](../../ATI_ARCHITECTURE/02_TRUST_BY_PHYSICS_PILLARS.md).
