# Veritas Protocol: Proof Format Specification

This directory defines the **technical format and cryptographic requirements** for the proofs generated by the FoundLab ATI.

The Veritas Protocol is the "Pillar of Mathematical Proof" within the broader **Auditable Trust Infrastructure**. While this directory specifies the *structure of a proof*, the strategic architecture that makes these proofs revolutionary is detailed in the main architecture documents.

- See [The Three Pillars of Trust by Physics](../../ATI_ARCHITECTURE/02_TRUST_BY_PHYSICS_PILLARS.md) for the role of the WORM Ledger and Crypto-Shredding.
- See [Cognitive Auditability & AI](../../ATI_ARCHITECTURE/03_COGNITIVE_AUDITABILITY_AI.md) for how the `rationale_hash` is integrated to provide proof of AI reasoning.
