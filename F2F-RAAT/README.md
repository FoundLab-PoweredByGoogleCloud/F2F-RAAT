# F2F-RAAT: Decision Engine Specification

This directory contains the core specification for the **From Fact to Feedback (F2F-RAAT)** deterministic decision engine.

F2F-RAAT is the primary rules engine that operates *within* the broader **Auditable Trust Infrastructure (ATI)**. It provides the formal, verifiable logic for processing reputational state and arriving at a decision.

It is a key component that is orchestrated by the cognitive layers of the ATI, as described in the main [ATI Architecture documents](../../ATI_ARCHITECTURE/).
