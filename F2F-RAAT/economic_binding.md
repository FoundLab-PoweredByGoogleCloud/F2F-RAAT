# Economic Binding Rules

This document details recommended patterns for economic effects, including:

- Slashing thresholds.  
- Hold durations.  
- Dynamic limits.  
- Pricing adjustments.  
- Collateralization logic.

All such effects MUST remain:

- deterministic,  
- policy-bound,  
- and fully auditable in Veritas.
