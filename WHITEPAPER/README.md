# Whitepaper & Glossary

This directory contains the original F2F-RAAT whitepaper and its associated glossary.

While historically important, this document should now be considered a **legacy artifact**. The most current, comprehensive, and strategically aligned description of the FoundLab architecture is located in the `ATI_ARCHITECTURE/` directory at the root of this repository.

The concepts introduced here have been superseded and integrated into the broader **Auditable Trust Infrastructure (ATI)** framework.
