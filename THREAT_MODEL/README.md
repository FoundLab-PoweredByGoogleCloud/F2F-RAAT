# Threat Model & Mitigations

This directory contains the threat model and mitigation patterns for the FoundLab **Auditable Trust Infrastructure (ATI)**.

The analysis of adversarial vectors and, more importantly, the architectural mitigations are central to our **"Trust by Physics"** approach. The patterns described here directly support the core pillars of the ATI.

For a strategic overview of how our architecture eliminates entire classes of risk, refer to the main [ATI Architecture documents](../../ATI_ARCHITECTURE/).
